## Abstract

This REP defines the timeline for future ROS 2 releases as well as the
targeted platforms for each specific one. We define platforms to include
both operating system releases (e.g. Ubuntu Xenial (16.04 LTS)) as well
as major language releases (e.g. Python 3.5). The target platforms
represent the set on which all core stacks are expected to work.
Exceptions can be made for stacks that are intentionally
platform-specific.

## Release Schedule

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The following applies to ROS 2 releases after Foxy. Prior to Foxy,
releases were made more frequently but with shorter support due to the
fact that many foundational parts of ROS 2 were still being heavily
developed.
::::

### Frequency

New ROS 2 releases will be published in a time based fashion **every 12
months**. The rationale is that a shorter cycle (like 6 months) results
in significant overhead and potentially many active releases at the same
time (assuming they have the same support length). On the other hand a
longer cycle (like 2 years) is too long for users to wait for new
features to be available in a ROS 2 release.

### Targeted Platforms

Since regular Ubuntu releases are only supported for 9 months ROS 2 will
not target those. A single ROS 2 distribution will only have full Tier 1
support for a **single** Ubuntu LTS. The rationale is that fully
supporting two LTS versions - which means 2-year-different versions of
upstream dependencies - is a tremendous overhead and sometimes even
impossible. On a case-by-case basis, a ROS 2 distribution may support an
older Ubuntu LTS distribution as a Tier 3, community-supported platform.

Since macOS (or at least brew) as well as Windows are rolling platforms
we aim to support the latest version available at the time of a ROS 2
distribution release. For Debian we also aim to target the latest stable
version though if that version is two years behind the Ubuntu version
that might not be possible.

### Support

#### LTS releases

Since Ubuntu LTS releases come with **5 years** of standard support we
aim to match the same duration. In even years new ROS 2 releases will
happen one month after the Ubuntu LTS has been released (which usually
means a ROS 2 release in May). The ROS 2 release will be supported until
the end of the standard support of the Ubuntu LTS release which is 4
years and 11 months from the ROS 2 release date.

#### Non-LTS Releases

In order to provide frequent releases to the community, in odd years a
non-LTS ROS 2 release will be published. It will always target the same
Ubuntu LTS as the previous ROS 2 LTS release but will only be supported
for **1.5 years**. This duration ensures that the non-LTS will overlap
with the next ROS LTS release by 6 months to provide a long enough
transition window.

#### Releases and support duration

- May 2021: G Turtle: non-LTS release, supported for 1.5 years
- May 2022: H Turtle: LTS release, supported for 5 years
- May 2023: I Turtle: non-LTS release, supported for 1.5 years
- May 2024: J Turtle: LTS release, supported for 5 years
- and so on, alternating annually between LTS and non-LTS releases

## Support Tiers

Platforms are defined as a combination of the OS, the architecture, and
the RMW implementation. By default the tiers are expected to apply up to
the desktop variant in a rosdistro, unless otherwise specified. ROS 2
variants are defined in REP 2001[^1].

Tier 1

Tier 1 platforms are subjected to our unit test suite and other testing
tools on a frequent basis including continuous integration jobs, nightly
jobs, packaging jobs, and performance testing. Errors or bugs discovered
in these platforms are prioritized for correction by the development
team. Significant errors discovered in Tier 1 platforms can impact
release dates and we strive to resolve all known high priority errors in
Tier 1 platforms prior to new version releases.

Tier 2

Tier 2 platforms are subject to periodic CI testing which runs both
builds and tests with publicly accessible results. The CI is expected to
be run at least within a week of relevant changes for the current state
of the ROS distribution. Package-level binary packages may not be
provided but providing a downloadable archive of the built workspace is
encouraged. Errors may be present in released product versions for Tier
2 platforms. Known errors in Tier 2 platforms will be addressed subject
to resource availability on a best effort basis and may or may not be
corrected prior to new version releases. One or more entities should be
committed to continuing support of the platform.

Tier 3

Tier 3 platforms are those for which community reports indicate that the
release is functional. The development team does not run the unit test
suite or perform any other tests on platforms in Tier 3. Installation
instructions should be available and up-to-date in order for a platform
to be listed in this category. Community members may provide assistance
with these platforms.

## Platforms by Distribution

If planned support for a target platform is changed, notice will be sent
to discourse to enable discussion of this issue.

\" \* \" means that this is not the upstream version (available on the

these dependencies during their lifetime. The versions shown for
OpenEmbedded are those provided by the 3.1 Dunfell release series; the
versions provided by the other supported release series are listed here:
<https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Package-Version-Differences> .
Note that the OpenEmbedded releases series for which a ROS distro has
support will change during its support time frame, as per the
OpenEmbedded support policy shown here:
<https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Policies#openembedded-release-series-support>

OSRF or the community (package built and distributed on custom
repositories).

\" \*\* \" Rolling distributions will see multiple version changes of
these dependencies during their lifetime. The versions shown for
OpenEmbedded are those provided by the 3.1 Dunfell release series; the
versions provided by the other supported release series are listed here:
<https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Package-Version-Differences> .
Note that the OpenEmbedded releases series for which a ROS distro has
support will change during its support time frame, as per the
OpenEmbedded support policy shown here:
<https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Policies#openembedded-release-series-support>
. However, it will always be supported by least one stable OpenEmbedded
release series.

\" \*\*\*\* \" webOS OSE provides this different version.

This document only captures the version at the first release of a ROS
distribution and will not be updated as the dependencies move forward.
These versions are thus a low watermark.

\" \* \" means default RMW implementation.

Middleware implementation support is dependent upon the platform support
tier. For example a Tier 1 middleware implementation on a Tier 2
platform can only receive Tier 2 support.

Minimum language requirements:

- C++17
- Python 3.9

\" \* \" means that this is not the upstream version (available on the
official Operating System repositories) but a package distributed by
OSRF or the community (package built and distributed on custom
repositories).

\" \*\* \" means that the dependency may see multiple version changes,
because the dependency uses a package manager that continually updates
the dependency without a stable API.

\" \*\*\* \" webOS OSE provides this different version.

This document only captures the version at the first release of a ROS
distribution and will not be updated as the dependencies move forward.
These versions are thus a low watermark.

Package manager use for dependencies:

- Ubuntu, Debian: apt, pip
- Windows: pixi/conda, pip
- macOS: Homebrew, pip
- RHEL: dnf
- OpenEmbedded: opkg

Build System Support:

- ament_cmake
- cargo
- cmake
- setuptools

### Rolling Ridley (June 2020 - Ongoing)

Rolling Ridley is a rolling development distribution of ROS 2 as
described in REP-2002[^15].

The target platform for Rolling Ridley will update as new upstream
distributions are selected for ROS 2 development. As of May 2025,
Rolling Ridley targets the same platforms as ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju.

## Motivation

This document is provided to help plan future development for libraries.
The primary platforms for ROS 2 are Canonical\'s Ubuntu releases, and
our intent is to track these releases as best as possible while also
allowing for current, thirdparty libraries to be used. macOS and Windows
being rolling distributions, ROS 2 will target the latest state of these
distributions at the time of the release.

## Rationale

Target platforms for future releases are speculative and are based on
consulting Ubuntu\'s release and end-of-life schedule[^16].
